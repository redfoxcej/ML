Read on for details and then click \\\"Join the Challenge\\\" if you'd like to compete or dig deeper into the specifics.Challenge Description: How do you measure justice? How do you solve the problem of racism in law enforcement? Collaborate with CPE in this Kaggle Data Science for Good Challenge to analyze racial inequality in police activity. The central part of this challenge involves making use of city, county, and census tract level data and combining it with geographic units that police departments use for deployment areas (e.g., precincts) and policies.  Host: Center for Policing Equity The Center for Policing Equity is an organization that consists of research scientists, race and equity experts, data virtuosos, and community trainers. Through partnerships with law enforcement and communities, CPE uses data to build fair and just systems that bridge the divide between communication, generational mistrust, and suffering.
